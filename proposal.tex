I. Introduction (1-2 paragraphs) 
What your main idea is and why it is interesting?
Clearly identify your topic; define key terms – cite as necessary
Motivate the study; tell the reader why it is important practically and theoretically
Identify a problem, e.g., lack of previous research and explain how your research addresses the problem
Ask a research question that follows from the above

Over the past two decades, prescription opioid abuse and addiction in the U.S. has become a health crisis of epidemic proportion. Since 1999, the number of overdose deaths from prescription opioids such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, and methadone, has more than quadrupled [1,2]. Social media media mining (SMM) has addressed public health concerns by  “infodemiology” and “toxicovigilance”.  For example, researchers have tracked the outbreak of flu epidemics using internet searches and Twitter posts [3,4,5]. Twitter data has also been used to track the expression of migraine headaches [6], detect misuse and abuse of prescription opioids [7,8,9], and monitor illegal online sales of prescription opioids [10]. Much of the evidence showing connections between Twitter posts and health behaviors is correlational; however, the relation between discussion of prescription opioid misuse on Twitter and actual misuse of opioids has not been clearly demonstrated [11]. 

This project seeks to examine the relations among social media users posting content related to the misuse of prescription opioids (MUPO). Mapping social media content related to prescription opioid use may help detect individuals at risk for misusing prescription opioids, and identify factors related to opioid addiction. The main goal of this project is to map the social network of prescription opioid misuse on Twitter. This proposal outlines several steps toward accomplishing this goal, which include: (a) Textual analysis of Twitter posts related to prescription opioid misuse, (b) Visualization of the geospatial location of Twitter users who post content on MUPO, and (c) Analysis of the social network of Twitter users who tweet about the MUPO. 

Research Questions 
This project is motivated by the following questions: 
(i) Can opioid misusers be detected by their Twitter posts? 
Can opioid misuse be detected from Twitter posts (e.g., hashtags)? 
(ii) Where (geographically) are Twitter users discussing opioid misuse? 
Can we map the geographic location of opioid misuse from Twitter posts? 
(iii) Can the social network of opioid misuse be mapped from Twitter users? 
Can the social network of opioid misuse be mapped from Twitter? 

[Liz] : (1) Can we replicate Chary et al. using methods and data available to us? (elaborate) 
(2) Can we find correlation between Twitter markers of poor emotional regulation and Twitter markers of opioid misuse? (3) Can we detect networks of opioid misusers using Twitter data?
If opioid use spreads through (real) social networks, is it reflected in digital ones? Can it spread through digital networks? 

[Nandita] Predicting those who are at risk of opioid misuse. using Twitter data to geographically identify the users at risk using keywords, which can be used to recognised relevant tweets.

Paragraph 1: Prescription Opioid Misuse, - Liz, Sean
The misuse and abuse of opioids in the U.S. is a crisis with serious public health consequences. In 2015, an estimated 2 million Americans suffered from substance use disorders related to prescription opioid pain relievers [1,2]. Of patients legitimately prescribed opioids for chronic pain, between 21 to 29 percent misused them, 8 to 12 percent developed an opioid use disorder, and approximately 4 to 6 percent transitioned to heroin [12,13]. Mobile health applications that monitor medication consumption have been developed to detect potential medication abuse [14]. Social media data has also been used as an early-warning system to forecast flu outbreaks by analyzing correlations between the frequency of flu-related Twitter posts and official reports of influenza-like-illness from the CDC [3,4]. This research suggests that Twitter data can provide valuable information about the spread of flu 1 to 2 weeks earlier than the CDC-ILI, that helps to supplement official reports. In this section we review similar research that used Twitter posts to track social media content related to the misuse of prescription opioids. 

[Liz] co-occurrence of terms suggesting emotional regulation deficits with terms suggesting opioid misuse, in the same people or in the same networks, with the idea that word use in tweets could be used to identify those at risk for opioid misuse.

Paragraph 4: Network Structure, Community Detection, Spreading and Diffusion - Sean

Like other behaviors, opioid misuse spreads by social contact. In terms of contagious disease the spreading or diffusion occurs within a network directly by person-to-person contact and indirectly by other pathways [19]. In the case of opioids, rather than describing persons as either infected or uninfected, it may be useful to consider people as more or less susceptible to misuse, dependence, or addiction, depending on individual and environmental factors [20]. Furthermore, the structure of the contact network can influence epidemic spreading [21]. The “small-world” property of many networks describes how distance nodes in a network is reduced by the pattern of connections within the network. For example, any two random acquaintances in a social network are connected, on average, by five to six intermediaries [22]. Contact networks of drug use may have small-world properties as a few highly connected nodes can rapidly transmit contagion (i.e., drugs) throughout the network [23]. In the case of simple contagion, weak ties among acquaintances or infrequent associations can also provide shortcuts between distant nodes within the network [24], and facilitate the spread of contagion or drug use. Social media research suggests that discussion of prescription drug abuse on Twitter is potentially reinforcing within an online social network [11]. Experimental evidence has also shown that the structure of an artificially constructed online community influenced the spreading of behavior, as individuals who received reinforcement from multiple connections within their social network were more likely to adopt a behavior [25]. Behavior also spreads farther and faster through with small-world networks that are clustered and latticed than random networks.



3. Identify the GAP in the literature that your project addresses:
E.g., This is known about A, and that is known about B, but little is known about the relationship of A to B.  (This is the gap your study will start to fill)

Past research has analyzed the textual content of Twitter posts related to MUPO, the geographical location of Twitter users posting about MUPO, yet to current knowledge, few studies have analyzed the structure of the social network of relations among Twitter users discussing MUPO. The present study addresses this gap in the literature by integrating different approaches to investigating MUPO in social media, including text analysis, geospatial mapping and network analysis to gain a better understanding of the structure of relations among Twitter users, to identify measures of centrality and community structure. 

III. Data Description should be 2-4 paragraphs and include:
Describe your publically available Twitter data subset.
Describe how the data is subset and justify your decisions. Your data may be temporally subset, meaning you collect "tweets" from a period of time. Your data may be subset by certain feature, meaning you only collect data from certain set of users, hashtags, categories. etc.

[Nandita] Network may show opioid usage relationship with emotions (sad, frustration, lonely) and or with situations (abuse, lonely, jobless, breakup, etc.) and or with other drugs (cocaine, mariujana, etc.).

The data will be extracted from Twitter API based on the following key terms [see Chary et al.]: 

Painkillers: painkiller*; pain killer*; narcotic painkiller*; oxycontin; vicodin; percodan; percocet; darvon; lortab; lorcet; dilaudid; demerol; lomotil; kadian; avinza; codeine; duragesic; methadone
[11] Hanson et al.


"[Survey] respondents indicated all prescription opioids they had ever misused from a list of 13 categories, with brand examples and street names: oxycodone (Oxycontin), oxycodone (Percocet, Percodan, Roxicet), hydrocodone (Vicodin, Lortab), propoxyphene (Darvocet, Darvon), acetaminophen with codeine (Tylenol with Codeine), Meriperidine (Demerol), hydromorphone (Dilaudid), norphindin, methadone, morphine (MS-Contin, Kadian, Avinza), fentanyl (Duragesic), fentanyl lollipop (Actiq), and tramadol (Ultram).

IV. Research Design and Methods should be 2-4 paragraphs and include: 
Describe main inference or analysis you would like to make with data. This is the "end goal" of the project. You don't have to know how you're going to get there, just what your main goal will be. For Robinson's Trump tweet analysis, the main goal was to identify Tweets written by Trump. For Culotta's flu paper, main goal was to see if tweets about flu and flu outbreaks were correlated. What do you want to do with data?

The main goals of the project are to conduct textual analysis of Twitter posts based on MUPO keywords to provide data for visualizing the geospatial location of Twitter users, and analysis of the social network of opioid misuse.   

Features to be extracted from Twitter data: KEYWORDS and what transformations TEXT ANALYSIS to do to reach your analytical goal. It's possible, but unlikely, that you can just use the raw data from the social media site as input to your analysis, but you will more likely have to transform the data for it to be usable. Will you use word counts? Do the data come with built-in features (author, time of posting, hashtags) that will be useful? Will you analyze your data as a network?

\appendix

We include an appendix with common issues that we see when students
submit papers. One particular important issue is not to use the
underscore in bibtex labels. Sharelatex allows this, but the
proceedings script we have does not allow this.

When you submit the paper you need to address each of the items in the
issues.tex file and verify that you have done them. Please do this
only at the end once you have finished writing the paper. To d this
cange TODO with DONE. However if you check something on with DONE, but
we find you actually have not executed it correcty, you will receive
point deductions. Thus it is important to do this correctly and not
just 5 minutes before the deadline. It is better to do a late
submission than doing the check in haste.
